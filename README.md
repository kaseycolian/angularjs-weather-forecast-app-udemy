Created with minimal instruction from Udemy Course: [Learn and Understand AngularJS](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/)

This project was generated with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) with minimal Bootstrap applied.

Udemy course was used as a guideline, but most code was written without instruction.  Form validation, HTTP promise handling, results formatting, HTML tables, ES6 syntax, and additional navigation were included without course instruction.
